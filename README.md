# FACTORS-AFFECTING-HOUSING-PRICES
# Purpose of the Repository

The aim of this project is to predict factors affecting housing prices given information on real estate propertie. 
The analysis will perform;

* Feature transformation and dimensionality reduction techniques so as to increase the quality of the feature space.
* Compare multiple reggression and choose the one that performs best.


# Success Metrics

* Sucessful Exploratory Data Analysis.
* Sucessful feature engineering.
* Sucessful check of multicollinearity.
* Sucessful Multiple Linear Regression.
* Sucessful Lasso Regression
* Sucessful Ridge Regression
* Sucessful Elastic Net Regression
* Sucessful Elastic Quantile Regression
* Sucessful Cross-validation of the Alpha value.
* Sucessful Computation of MSE on all models.
* Creation of residual plots for the linear base line model.
* Sucessful assessment their heteroscedasticity.
